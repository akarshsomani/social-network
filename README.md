# All the programs are written in python 3 with the help of pakage networkx.

Some of the implementation of theorie of social networking are here.

Week2- Given some nodes add edges randomly until it is connected.
Week3- girwan's algorithm and brute force
Week4- fatman evolutionary model
Week5- schekking model implimentation and working with signed network with edges with either + or -.
Week6- point distribution method and random walk method(for ranking most popular node if we start wisiting nodes randomly in a network)
Week7- using property of cascading that if we start from a key node then most of the other nodes will be in influence. here comes the concept of social influence.
Week9- barabassi elbert model and erdos reny model.

The blank weeks denotes the learning period.
